# Python Crash Course
I created this repository for the programs I write as I go through the book [*Python Crash Course*](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=python+crash+course&qid=1655498328&sprefix=python+crash%2Caps%2C57&sr=8-1) by Eric Matthes. I've grouped programs by chapter for the beginning of the book and by project for the later parts of the book where projects may span multiple chapters.
